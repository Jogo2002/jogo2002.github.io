## Introduction

In this project, I investigate whether gold and silver exhibit the same level of day-to-day price volatility.  
Gold and silver are both precious metals often used as investment hedges against inflation and market risk, but their price behaviors differ: gold functions more as a monetary store of value, while silver also has heavy industrial demand.

Using daily price data from **Yahoo Finance** (tickers `GC=F` for gold and `SI=F` for silver), I compute daily log returns and perform a **permutation test** under the null hypothesis that the two metals have equal volatility (standard deviation of daily returns).  

Because financial returns are often non-normal, a permutation test is a robust, simulation-based way to test this difference without assuming normality.

## Load packages and import data
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(quantmod)
library(tidyverse)
library(infer)
library(purrr)

# Download daily gold and silver futures prices
getSymbols("GC=F", src = "yahoo", from = "2020-01-01", to = Sys.Date())
getSymbols("SI=F", src = "yahoo", from = "2020-01-01", to = Sys.Date())

# Extract closing prices and compute daily log returns
returns <- tibble(
  date = index(Cl(`GC=F`)),
  Gold = as.numeric(dailyReturn(Cl(`GC=F`), type = "log")),
  Silver = as.numeric(dailyReturn(Cl(`SI=F`), type = "log"))
) |> drop_na()

# Pivot to long format
returns_long <- returns |>
  pivot_longer(cols = c(Gold, Silver),
               names_to = "Metal",
               values_to = "Return")
